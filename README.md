Basic Bacterial Assembler using fastp, fastqc and Spades for NextSeq 2000 paired end data

In order to use it just need to install all the above tools to your system.

Create a folder which contains all the fastq's of the strains you want to assemble. Specify the full path of the folder with the parameter --input_path and the programm will create a "results" file which will contain all the produced data of every sample.
